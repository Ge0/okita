Okita (**O**pen **K**ernel **I**nstrumenting **T**o **A**ssembly) is currently a set of proof-of-concepts aiming at disassembling binaries to asm sources.

The main goal is to be able to do :

```
./naive_disassembler.py binary_to_disass
nasm -f bin generated_source.asm -o generated_bin
```

So binary_to_disass == generated_bin first and foremost.

TODO: providing this empty README.md with way more information! :o)
